# Lets-math!
A real-time calculator web app built mainly with vanilla Javascript and some jQuery with Python Flask web framework. The app utilizes SocketIO for real-time broadcasting and SQLAlchemy to access and edit calculation history database. Lets-math! is now hosted with Heroku at http://lets-math.herokuapp.com.

It is intuitive to use the calculator as its design mainly derived from iOS calculators. You can type your username in the 'User Name' input box if you'd like to tell others that you are making calculations in the app. Everyone on the website should see what others calculated. The calculator has the 4 usual +-*/ operations plus I've added the modulus (Mod) operation that calculates the remainder of 2 numbers, and a button to reverse the polarity of a digit (negative to positive and vice versa).
